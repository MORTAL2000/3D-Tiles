3D-Tiles
-
Working on a demo of fast tiled 3D map rendering using glMultiDrawElementsIndirect and some other methods.
Think maps like the levels in [Captain Toad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m91qkP5ZaN8) where it's tiled but
tiles can have different geometry and aren't necessarily uniform in size.
